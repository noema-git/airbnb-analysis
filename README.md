## Motivation for the project<a name="motivation"></a>

This analysis and the additional blog post was done as a project within the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree. 
I am a resident in Munich, Germany so I find that data particularly interesting.
In order to get a better insight into Airbnb, especially in Munich, I am particularly interested in the answers to the following three questions:

- When is the most expensive time of the year to visit Munich and how much do the price spike?
- What are the most expensive neighbourhoods in Munich? 
- What factors influence the price most?
